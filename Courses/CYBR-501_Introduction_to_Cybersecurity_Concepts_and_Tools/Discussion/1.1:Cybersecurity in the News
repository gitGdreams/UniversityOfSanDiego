How do you keep yourself up-to-date with cybersecurity news? What news service, publication, security blog, security forums, etc. do you use? (If you have never used a news service, pick one and start keeping up with current events in cybersecurity).
In your view, what was the most important cybersecurity article of the last week?
Response
Review several of your peers’ posts and then post a thoughtful, substantive response to at least two of your classmates by Day 7. You are encouraged to post your required replies early in the week to promote more meaningful and interactive discourse, checking back frequently until Day 7.

My Post:
To stay current with the evolving field of cybersecurity, I often follow Bugcrowd blogs and watch related content on YouTube. Bugcrowd’s blog is a fantastic resource for understanding emerging trends, practical advice, and insights into cybersecurity community. Here's a blog I found particularly interesting from last month/year: 2025 Cybersecurity Predictions (TrustMeLinkLinks to an external site.).

In my view, the most important cybersecurity article I read last week was “What is a Bug Bounty Program?” from Bugcrowd. Here’s the link: TrustMeLinkLinks to an external site.. This article highlights the role of bug bounty programs in improving organizational security and how they connect ethical hackers with opportunities to identify and resolve vulnerabilities.

I’m genuinely inspired by the bug bounty community and aspire to be a part of it. However, I know I still need to refine my skills and gain more hands-on experience in vulnerability research to kickstart my career in this field.
